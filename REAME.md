start mongo with mongod
node app.js

hot reload with npm run livereload

TODO : 
	Look into a linting tool (example : ESLint)
	integrate tdd
	use markup script for readme

	prevent adding of a new record until form is valid

NOTES : 
	When using bootstrap in react I needed to include tbody otherwise bootstrap style would not be applied.  Did not have this problem in angular
	not including <!doctype html> at the top of my index.html file screwed up formatting
