start mongo with mongod
node app.js

TODO : 
	Get a hot reloader tool
	Look into a linting tool
	integrate tdd
	use markup script for readme

NOTES : 
	When using bootstrap in react I needed to include tbody otherwise bootstrap style would not be applied.  Did not have this problem in angular
	not including <!doctype html> at the top of my index.html file screwed up formatting
