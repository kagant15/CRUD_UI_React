start mongo with mongod
node app.js

hot reload with npm run livereload

TODO : 
	Integrate with Redux
	update readme to account for every file, structure, and library (example: public - files on deployed app, server - backend code etc...)
	100% code coverage
	Look into a linting tool (example : ESLint)
	Integrate tdd
	Use markup script for readme

Functional:
	prevent adding of a new record until form is valid
	login

NOTES : 
	When using bootstrap in react I needed to include tbody otherwise bootstrap style would not be applied.  Did not have this problem in angular
	not including <!doctype html> at the top of my index.html file screwed up formatting
